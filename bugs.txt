when turning from vertical to horizontal against a pill it does not behave the same way as when it's against the wall
lower levels should have viruses lower on the screen
manually moving a pill down should reset the timeout (so there is a proper amount of delay)
there should be a proper amount of delay when blocks are destroyed during dropBlocks function
